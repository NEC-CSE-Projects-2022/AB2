## Abstract
Stock price prediction remains a challenging prob
lem due to the inherent noise, volatility, and nonlinearity of
f
inancial time series. Traditional statistical approaches often fail
to fully capture these complexities, whereas deep learning models,
despite their predictive power, are computationally expensive,
prone to overfitting, and lack interpretability—limiting their
practical use in financial decision-making. In this paper, we
propose a lightweight yet effective preprocessing framework
that focuses on variance stabilization to enhance stock price
forecasting. The methodology sequentially applies a logarithmic
transformation followed by a Yeo–Johnson power transformation
to reduce skewness and heteroscedasticity, thereby improving
data distribution for linear modeling. After preprocessing, a
Ridge Regression model with mild regularization is employed to
handle multicollinearity among correlated stock features such as
Open, High, and Low prices. The approach was evaluated using
historical Google stock data, achieving an R² score of 0.97–0.98,
with near-zero Mean Squared Error (MSE) and significantly re
duced prediction variance. Experimental results demonstrate that
a carefully designed variance-stabilized preprocessing pipeline
can substantially improve the accuracy and robustness of linear
models, providing an interpretable and computationally efficient
alternative to more complex deep learning architectures for stock
price prediction.Unlike prior work that applies single-stage log
or Box–Cox normalization, this study introduces a sequential
log–power normalization strategy that integrates logarithmic com
pression with Yeo–Johnson variance stabilization. This dual-stage
preprocessing improves linear model conditioning and enhances
interpretability for financial forecasting.

## Our Improvement Over Existing Paper
Compared to the referenced paper, our work introduces practical, implementation-level improvements while preserving the original modeling philosophy. We design a fully reproducible end-to-end pipeline that strictly separates training, validation, and inference to prevent data leakage. All preprocessing steps, including logarithmic shifting, Yeo–Johnson transformation, and standard scaling, are saved and reused during prediction, improving deployment reliability. The model supports dynamic column alignment and missing-feature handling, enabling robust use across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, performance evaluation is standardized with consistent metrics and automated reporting. These enhancements transform the original experimental framework into a deployment-ready, transparent, and reusable stock prediction system for real applications.

## About the Project
Give a simple explanation of:
- What your project does
- This project predicts future stock closing prices using historical stock market data. It applies advanced data preprocessing techniques to stabilize price fluctuations and then uses a Ridge Regression model to generate accurate and reliable stock price predictions.
- Why it is useful
- Stock market data is noisy and highly volatile, which often reduces prediction accuracy. By stabilizing variance and reducing skewness before modeling, this project improves prediction accuracy while keeping the model simple, fast, and interpretable. This makes it suitable for academic use as well as real-world financial analysis and decision support.
- General project workflow (input → processing → model → output)
- Stock data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) is taken as input → data is preprocessed using logarithmic and Yeo–Johnson transformations with scaling → Ridge Regression model is trained → predicted stock prices are generated and compared with actual values.
