## Abstract
Stock price prediction remains a challenging prob
lem due to the inherent noise, volatility, and nonlinearity of
f
inancial time series. Traditional statistical approaches often fail
to fully capture these complexities, whereas deep learning models,
despite their predictive power, are computationally expensive,
prone to overfitting, and lack interpretability—limiting their
practical use in financial decision-making. In this paper, we
propose a lightweight yet effective preprocessing framework
that focuses on variance stabilization to enhance stock price
forecasting. The methodology sequentially applies a logarithmic
transformation followed by a Yeo–Johnson power transformation
to reduce skewness and heteroscedasticity, thereby improving
data distribution for linear modeling. After preprocessing, a
Ridge Regression model with mild regularization is employed to
handle multicollinearity among correlated stock features such as
Open, High, and Low prices. The approach was evaluated using
historical Google stock data, achieving an R² score of 0.97–0.98,
with near-zero Mean Squared Error (MSE) and significantly re
duced prediction variance. Experimental results demonstrate that
a carefully designed variance-stabilized preprocessing pipeline
can substantially improve the accuracy and robustness of linear
models, providing an interpretable and computationally efficient
alternative to more complex deep learning architectures for stock
price prediction.Unlike prior work that applies single-stage log
or Box–Cox normalization, this study introduces a sequential
log–power normalization strategy that integrates logarithmic com
pression with Yeo–Johnson variance stabilization. This dual-stage
preprocessing improves linear model conditioning and enhances
interpretability for financial forecasting.
